# Highlight RMS haters

This userscript (badly) highlights those who have signed the [RMS Open letter](https://github.com/rms-open-letter/rms-open-letter.github.io)

I am not a programmer, I make this as a simple task and hopefully you can help me improve it

All it does is load an external stylesheet from this repo that is auto-generated from the list of signed names, it includes a shell script for how the names are obtained too.

The stylesheet is rather large but the end justifies the means.

Commits and PRs are welcome
